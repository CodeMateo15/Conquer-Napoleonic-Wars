Hello everyone, thank you for downloading my game!

Here we are, after 6 months. This is a Risk-like video game that leans on being simple. Simple controls and simple graphics. As this is made only by me, it is a bit broken. It is not totally balanced, some texts do not delete, and whenever you click on the attack/buy button it clicks the one underneath. Nonetheless the game still runs. Play a bit, and give me some feedback and ideas. It means a lot to me, so again thank you.

To play on windows, download the windows zip file and click the executable file to start it.

Also here is a quick two-second fix for the “Can’t Be Opened Because Apple Cannot Check For Malicious Software” Mac Error
-Open Finder
-Traverse through to “Applications” Folder
-Highlight the software you are trying to Open
-Press “control”
-Right “Click” & Select “Open”

Do note that this was done with unformal training and youTube tutorials, so there is a LOT of unholy coding practices lol (please do not judge, this was a huge learning project for me)
